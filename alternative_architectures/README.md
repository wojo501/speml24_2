There are two alternative architectures which have been abandoned in the course of the project in favour of tensorflow

- **oldsyft**: Using Pysyft from 2018 which still supported Federated Learning out of the box. It is working and we provide some basic results. but the architecture is rather outdated.
- **newsyft**: Using a modern version of pysyft, to see if federated learning architecture can still be manually replicated. This architecture is a failed experiment and not runnable.
